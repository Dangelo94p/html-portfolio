<h2>Top 3 best movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Nick and Norah's infinite playlist</h3>
<p>It's funny a great movie where teens enjoy their night in the big apple, New York City.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>I haven't decided which movie I personally loved because I feel like all of them just goes into this long story of good versus evil and magic that just fills your heart.</p>

<h3>Scott Pilgrim Versus The World</h3>
<p>I enjoyed the video game and the movie isnt the worse, it's on my top list because the world aspect is cool and the energy I like from it is enjoying your youth and fight for what you truly want in life.</p>
